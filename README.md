# Gravity-Simulation-Unity
A physics simulation created for studies. It simulates gravity around planets and other celestial objects and showing their movement in a sped up time. In the first version it was 3d and mostly operated on creating random planets with different mass and size. Second one was in 2d but allowed to choose start velocity and direction with possibility to change parameters still.
